# DTracker

This is an ongoing project that involves multiple components involving 
- Web technologies
- Custom made API
- Persistent data storage
- and Back-End management

Personal note:
YOU MUST RUN ROUTES.PY IN THE FLASK DIRECTORY BEFORE RUNNING THE `DECAY COMMAND IN 
DISCORD OR SENDING API REQUESTS. YOU WILL GET CONNECTION REFUSED SINCE THERE IS 
NOTHING LISTENING ON THE REQUEST PORT.

python3 flask/routes.py
python3 bot.py
